### [motivate: Add 20 quotes](https://github.com/mubaris/motivate/issues/3)

### [NoSQLMap: application crashes if no random string size is entered](https://github.com/codingo/NoSQLMap/issues/45)
This was my first time using python. I contacted the moderator since I was not able to run it. It was nice to learn python's syntax just to fix the problem.

### Others
I also tried many other issues but could not get them to work. I think the most difficult part was to get the development environments right.
